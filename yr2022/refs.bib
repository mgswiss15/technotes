In this work, we focus on the modern equivalent of the Erdos–Rényi random graph model: the graph variational autoencoder ({GVAE}) (Simonovsky and Komodakis 2018 Int. Conf. on Artificial Neural Networks pp 412–22). This model assumes edges and nodes are independent in order to generate entire graphs at a time using a multi-layer perceptron decoder. As a result of these assumptions, {GVAE} has difficulty matching the training distribution and relies on an expensive graph matching procedure. We improve this class of models by building a message passing neural network into {GVAE}’s encoder and decoder. We demonstrate our model on the specific task of generating small organic molecules.},

    abstract = {Most few-shot learning techniques are pre-trained on a large, labeled "base dataset". In problem domains where such large labeled datasets are not available for pre-training (e.g., X-ray, satellite images), one must resort to pre-training in a different "source" problem domain (e.g., {ImageNet}), which can be very different from the desired target task. Traditional few-shot and transfer learning techniques fail in the presence of such extreme differences between the source and target tasks. In this paper, we present a simple and effective solution to tackle this extreme domain gap: self-training a source domain representation on unlabeled data from the target domain. We show that this improves one-shot performance on the target domain by 2.9 points on average on the challenging {BSCD}-{FSL} benchmark consisting of datasets from multiple domains.

    abstract = {We introduce a new generative model where samples are produced via Langevin dynamics using gradients of the data distribution estimated with score matching. Because gradients can be ill-defined and hard to estimate when the data resides on low-dimensional manifolds, we perturb the data with different levels of Gaussian noise, and jointly estimate the corresponding scores, i.e., the vector fields of gradients of the perturbed data distribution for all noise levels. For sampling, we propose an annealed Langevin dynamics where we use gradients corresponding to gradually decreasing noise levels as the sampling process gets closer to the data manifold. Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons. Our models produce samples comparable to {GANs} on {MNIST}, {CelebA} and {CIFAR}-10 datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art inception score of 8.87 on {CIFAR}-10. Additionally, we demonstrate that our models learn effective representations via image inpainting experiments.},

Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very diﬃcult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simpliﬁes to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete ﬁlter set for natural image data.},

This yields several useful insights. It defines a proper probabilistic model for the denoising autoencoder technique, which makes it in principle possible to sample from them or rank examples by their energy. It suggests a different way to apply score matching that is related to learning to denoise and does not require computing second derivatives. It justifies the use of tied weights between the encoder and decoder and suggests ways to extend the success of denoising autoencoders to a larger family of energy-based models.},

    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07200},
    abstract = {Recent progress on few-shot learning largely relies on annotated data for meta-learning: base classes sampled from the same domain as the novel classes. However, in many applications, collecting data for meta-learning is infeasible or impossible. This leads to the cross-domain few-shot learning problem, where there is a large shift between base and novel class domains. While investigations of the cross-domain few-shot scenario exist, these works are limited to natural images that still contain a high degree of visual similarity. No work yet exists that examines few-shot learning across different imaging methods seen in real world scenarios, such as aerial and medical imaging. In this paper, we propose the Broader Study of Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning ({BSCD}-{FSL}) benchmark, consisting of image data from a diverse assortment of image acquisition methods. This includes natural images, such as crop disease images, but additionally those that present with an increasing dissimilarity to natural images, such as satellite images, dermatology images, and radiology images. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark are performed to evaluate state-of-art meta-learning approaches, transfer learning approaches, and newer methods for cross-domain few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that state-of-art meta-learning methods are surprisingly outperformed by earlier meta-learning approaches, and all meta-learning methods underperform in relation to simple fine-tuning by 12.8\% average accuracy. Performance gains previously observed with methods specialized for cross-domain few-shot learning vanish in this more challenging benchmark. Finally, accuracy of all methods tend to correlate with dataset similarity to natural images, verifying the value of the benchmark to better represent the diversity of data seen in practice and guiding future research.},

    abstract = {This paper presents {SimCLR}: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on {ImageNet}. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by {SimCLR} achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised {ResNet}-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming {AlexNet} with 100X fewer labels.},

However, modeling complex distributions over graphs and then efficiently sampling from these distributions is challenging due to the non-unique, high-dimensional nature of graphs and the complex, non-local dependencies that exist between edges in a given graph. Here we propose {GraphRNN}, a deep autoregressive model that addresses the above challenges and approximates any distribution of graphs with minimal assumptions about their structure. {GraphRNN} learns to generate graphs by training on a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph generation process into a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on the graph structure generated so far. In order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of {GraphRNN}, we introduce a benchmark suite of datasets, baselines and novel evaluation metrics based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy, which measure distances between sets of graphs. Our experiments show that {GraphRNN} significantly outperforms all baselines, learning to generate diverse graphs that match the structural characteristics of a target set, while also scaling to graphs 50 times larger than previous deep models.},

Numerous methods provide accessible ways to approximate stationary but indefinite kernels. However, they are either biased or possess large variance. In this article, we propose the generalized orthogonal random features, an unbiased estimation with lower variance.Experimental results on various datasets and kernels verify that our algorithm achieves lower variance and approximation error compared with the existing kernel approximation methods. With better approximation to the originally selected kernels, improved classification accuracy and regression ability is obtained with our approximation algorithm in the framework of support vector machine and regression.},
