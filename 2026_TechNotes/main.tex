{\large Magda's 2026 set of technical notes}

{\hfill Last update: \today}

This is the 2026 set of my technical notes on various ML topics.
I started writing the 1st set when beginning my PhD, continued as postdoc and occassionally even as prof. 
As a prof I have less time but picking up at least some of the good old habits might help in bringing me back from admin to research.
All previous docs are available in my GitHub repo \url{https://github.com/mgswiss15/technotes}.

The general purpose of the notes is to help me understand better the selected topics by re-explaining (\emph{re-} because these have been explained elsewhere many times), and to have a reference and possibly reusable material for later.

This is a working document not meant to be polished. There may be typos and other editing errors. 
Technical errors mean that I didn't quite understand something which I unfortunately cannot rule out.
